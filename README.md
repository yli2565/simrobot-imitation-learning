# Before you start

Please create a environment with TypedShmem installed (scripts/recompileTypedShmem.sh).

Please also ensure you are using a vncserver with VirtualGL enabled, you can check with scripts/checkVGL.sh. When running the simulator, if you should have 80+ steps per second, if you see roughly 20 steps per second, VirtualGL is probably disabled.
